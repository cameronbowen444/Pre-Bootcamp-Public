# Pre-Bootcamp-Public
--------------------------------

This was the very first step in getting offically accepted into the Coding Dojo BootCamp as a full stack developer. 

We started understanding the basic concepts of writing code in html and js (Basic components that make up a website).

Results Of The Pre-BootCamp:
  - Understanding html indentation
